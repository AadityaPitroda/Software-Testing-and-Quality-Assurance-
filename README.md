# Software Testing and Quality Assurance:

# Project Setup Guide

## Introduction
This README file provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide to setting up a Java project using Eclipse IDE. This project utilizes Selenium for automated web testing, along with supporting libraries and tools. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure the successful configuration and execution of the project.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Eclipse IDE
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8
- Google Chrome browser (ensure you have the matching Chrome Driver)

## Project Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Open Eclipse IDE
1. Launch the Eclipse IDE on your computer.
2. Ensure that your Eclipse IDE is configured to use the JDK 1.8 or higher.

### Step 2: Create a Java Project
1. Go to the menu bar and select `File > New > Java Project`.
2. In the "New Java Project" window, enter a name for your project.
3. Set the execution environment to `JavaSE-1.8`.
4. Click `Finish` to create the project.

### Step 3: Add External JAR Files
1. Right-click on your project in the `Package Explorer`.
2. Select `Build Path > Add External Archives`.
3. Browse and select the following JAR files to add them to your project's build path:
   - `selenium-jave-client-driver-1.0.2.jar`
   - `jxl-2.6.jar`
   - `slf4j-api-2.0.16.jar`
   - `selenium-java-4.5.0.jar`
   - `selenium-server-standalone-3.5.3.jar`

### Step 4: Add Chrome Driver
1. Download the Chrome Driver corresponding to your installed version of Google Chrome.
2. Ensure the downloaded `chromedriver.exe` is placed in an accessible directory.
3. Add the Chrome Driver to the project by configuring the system property in your code.

### Step 5: Create Java Class and Write Java Code
1. In the `Package Explorer`, right-click on the `src` folder of your project.
2. Select `New > Class`.
3. Enter a name for your Java class and click `Finish`.
4. Write your Java code, including necessary imports and the configuration for using Selenium WebDriver.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure all JAR dependencies are correctly added to the project to avoid compilation issues.
- Always use the Chrome Driver version that matches your installed Chrome browser version.
- Regularly update Selenium and other libraries to their latest versions for more features and stability.

## Conclusion
By following the above steps, you will successfully set up your Java project in Eclipse with Selenium for automated web testing. For further information and customization, refer to the official documentation of Selenium and other libraries.
